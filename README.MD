- Return to the previous CurrentGlyphs using ⇧+,

### Version 1.1

- Improved Glyph menu items
- Added SF symbol icons to menu items for kicks
- Got the history working (with some minor issues)

 ```
    Glyph
        Next Glyph
        Previous Glyph
        -------------------------------------
        <  Return to *glyphname 0*       ⇧+,
        << Return to History              >
                *glyphname 1*
                *glyphname 2*
                *glyphname 3*
                *glyphname 4*
                *glyphname 5*
                *glyphname 6*
                *glyphname 7*
                *glyphname 8*
                *glyphname 9*
        -------------------------------------
```

### Needed Improvements

- The Return to History submenu starts with a bunch of blank "glyphname" items because if I add them later, they are disabled (bug?).
- Figure out how to show the ⇧+, keyboard shortcut next to the "Return to *glyphname 0*" menu item.
- Customizeable shortcut? I use ⇧+, because Fontlab ruined my brain and I use , to go back to the previous glyph. Young bucks might find ⇧+⌘+( more intuative.
