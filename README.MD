# Return to Glyph

Remember your most recent CurrentGlyphs

Return to the pervious CurrentGlyphs using ⇧+,

or use the Glyph menu to jump back in your recent CurrentGlyph history

### Version 1.1

- Improved Glyph menu items
- Added SF symbol icons to menu items for kicks
- Got the history working (with some minor issues)

    # Glyph
    #     Next Glyph
    #     Previous Glyph
    #     ---------------------------------
    #     <  Return to *glyphname 0*       ⇧+,
    #     << Return to History              >
    #                           *glyphname 1*
    #                           *glyphname 2*
    #                           *glyphname 3*
    #                           *glyphname 4*
    #                           *glyphname 5*
    #                           *glyphname 6*
    #                           *glyphname 7*
    #                           *glyphname 8*
    #                           *glyphname 9*
    #     ---------------------------------


### Version 1.0

Added a menu item in the Glyph menu to help remind me this tool exists


---

### Needed improvements

Figure out how to show the ⇧+, keyboard shortcut next to the "Return to *glyphname 0*" menu item

Glyph History starts with a bunch of blank items because if we add them later, they are disabled (bug?).

Does this get confused if the CurrentFont changes?
